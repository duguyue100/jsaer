# jsAER

A collection of tools for Address-Event Representation (AER) neuromorphic processing in JavaScript.

This project is in planning stage, and it's just for me to sharp my JS skills (which I know very little about).
So you may not see any progress any soon. But the first stage, I would like to duplicate the viewer from jAER and make it efficient to display AEDAT from a browser.

If I can do the first stage, I'm probably gonna proceed to second stage where connecting neuromorphic hardware using a browser.
If this second stage didn't go anywhere, I'm gonna focus on implementing algorithms and improving visualization.

We will see then.

After a little research, it seems that JS libraries can be written in multiple files and then minify them together, so something like Matlab style then. I don't want to include a lot other libraries for computing, but at some point, I guess I have to. This will definitely ease my workflow but slow down the loading speed, I would find a way to wrap them so that it's not messy (There is no obvious way of including a JS file into another JS file). I don't want to develop it with NodeJS, but keep it as a very much light weight browser thing. This might limit my capability of accessing hardware, but well, let's try, and frankly, it's not very important at this moment.
