# jsAER

A collection of tools for Address-Event Representation (AER) neuromorphic processing in JavaScript.

This project is in planning stage, and it's just for me to sharp my JS skills (which I know very little about).
So you may not see any progress any soon. But the first stage, I would like to duplicate the viewer from jAER and make it efficient to display AEDAT from a browser.

If I can do the first stage, I'm probably gonna proceed to second stage where connecting neuromorphic hardware using a browser.
If this second stage didn't go anywhere, I'm gonna focus on implementing algorithms and improving visualization.

We will see then.
